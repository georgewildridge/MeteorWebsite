Prog Update #1:George and I are working on a social networking website, called ChoateBook. ChoateBook will be a platform for discussing class enrollments. A student will be able to create a class, along with its associated variables, (block, teacher, location, etc.,) and other students will be able to enroll in the class. As such, students will easily be able to see who will be in their classes, teachers will be able to see whom they will teach, and things like exchanging classes between two students in fully booked courses will be more easily brokered. We are working in HTML, CSS, and Javascript using the Meteor Javascript platform. We are working together on the Cloud9 online IDE. So far George and I have created the basic structure of a website and made it accessible on a Meteor server, and have started to learn Javascript using an online tutorial at CodeAcademy.com. We still need to code for the website to actually do what we want it to, namely make buttons which allow students to create a class, enroll in it by entering their names, etc. We also need to learn how to use CSS to make our website pretty. Taking on learning the three new languages necessary for this project will make it very tricky; however, we believe we can manage it. We mainly worry about the CSS work. We think it will be difficult to make our site look good.

Prog update #2:
We are still working on ChoateBook, a class-based social networking webapp which would allow the user to enroll in and create classes and see who else is in them, as well as information about the class. George and I have finished making it through the Javascript and Meteor tutorials on Codeacademy.com and MeteorTips.com respectively. We have created a simple prototype website with buttons which don’t yet do anything. We have a basic layout and CSS, but we hope to make it look nicer soon. We are primarily focused now on building a dropdown menu to enter in the information about a new class, as well as a way to store data on who is in each class. We will then need to find a way to access all this data in another dropdown list. Then we will have to publish the webapp so others can access it. We would like some help figuring out how to create this dropdown menu if possible. Learning Meteor has been a difficult challenge. We’re glad that we now have an up-and-running website, but it’s difficult to get it to do what we want.

Prog update #3 (Final):
